        Disclosure:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Cryptocurrency and NFTs are volatile assets. We can not speculate future price or market conditions. Do not invest more than you are willing to lose.<br>
        Even the best cryptocurrencies and NFTs have dropped over 80%. All we guarantee is transparency, consistency, and good vibes.<br>
        We have no affiliation to any of the derivative art in this NFT collection. Chests are saluting and supporting our paired tokens at launch that have burned liquidity.<br>
        Companions are a salute to legacy NFT collections on Cronos and Ethereum. Both are only meant to bring awareness to Cronos, Cryptocurrency's, NFTs, and memecoins as a whole.

        Overview:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The Turtle token was launched on the Cronos Blockchain Mar 19 2024, and abandoned by its original dev in Early May 2024. The community has taken over since.<br>
        CryptoDaave has led this initiative and continued building liquidity on VVS Finance, the preferred DEX on Cronos with the help of the community. We have also now been whitelisted on Ebisu's Bay and started growing liquidity there. There is also liquidity on CronaSwap and MMFinance.<br>
        The original dev burned his keys to the first MMF LP before leaving. As a CTO, there was no funding for development growth. This is a non tax token and all of the supply was circulating from day one.<br>
        It is original branding and not a derivative. We need funds for future developments, and the majority of liquidity burned in all of our trading pairs.<br>
        We are launching a non-profit NFT collection to further our reach in the space as a community and gather funds for NFT/CTO costs, development, and liquidity burning.<br>
        We will share the full details and the planning for the $TURTLE token and NFT collection below.<br>
        Both, the Turtle Token and the Turtle NFTs will be designed to work together and bring value to each other through mandatory minimum held of each token in order to earn more Turtle.<br>
        The NFT ownership will form a DAO for voting based on any major decisions for the brand.

        Turtle Overview:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We have over 20 trading pairs. All have burned liquidity. We would like our main CRO liquidity pool on VVS Finance to be much bigger than our MMF pool to reduce the impact on trades,
        and with a minimum amount of burned 80% liquidity. It is approximately 25% bigger than MMF now. It will be done slowly over time with funds allocated from NFTS.<br>
        We will also set aside treasury funds for future CEX listings and/or development in the community vault.<br>
        Any funds in the vault that are to be used for growth and development will be voted by the community Dao formed through NFT ownership before spending.<br>
        Our first goals as a community will be coin gecko and CMC listings. As a CTO, we have a new X page, website, and Dexscreener paid for. The NFTs will introduce a way to earn Turtle with a FIXED rate, adjustable every year.<br>

        TURTLE NFT Overview:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Non-profit 10,625 piece collection with 216 traits living on the Cronos Blockchain using an ERC721 contract. Hand drawn art. Original branding, not a derivative.<br>
        We will focus on Cronos and cross chain EVM partnerships to grow community and exposure in the space. Our main focus will be on gaming partnerships where the token can be used in their platforms, but not limited to.<br>
        We will also introduce a NFT staking contract joined with Turtle to earn daily Turtle for holding.

        TURTLE NFT Distribution:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        500 Admin mint for Turtlecommunity-vault.cro to be owned by DAO.<br>
        150 Admin mint Cryptodaave<br>
        150 Admin mint DarkmindofL<br>
        1200 Admin Mint airdrops to early registered wallets, top 200 Turtle token holders, CamelsNFT holders with 4 or more, and Camels 3D holders with 2 or more. Completed on May 3, 2025. Some remain throughout mint.<br>
        2625 mints maximum at a 200,000 turtle mint cost. About $12 at launch, adjusting over time with progress of token and mint.<br>
        6000 public paid mints x 240 CRO Approximately $20 USD in CRO, adjusted in major price moves.
      </p>
      <p class="subheader-text text-primary mt-4">
        Turtle NFT Cost and Fund Allocation:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        2625-public mint at cost of 200,000 turtle to start. This is to reward, thin out wallets of long term holders, and bring some chart stability.<br>
        Turtle will be only used towards burned liquidity and earnings contracts. We have 3 years supply of earning contracts pre mint. Liquidity burning will be the first focus.
        <br><br>
        6000-public mint at $20 USD. Goal of total funds raised at end of mint is $120,000.
        <br><br>
        Broken down in percentages below, this is how the funds from public minting plan to be allocated. Depending on the speed of minting process,
        funds will not be removed from mint contract until they reach minimum even numbers for easy division. IE:$1000, $5000, $10,000 increments.
        <ul>
          <li>
            25% of mint funds go to team. This covers entire cost of CTO to date, existing burned liquidity, existing turtle allocated for staking, existing turtle owned by community DAO vault, dev costs to launch NFTs, DAO contracts, staking contracts, website mint upgrades, artist, and unexpected miscellaneous costs regarding CTO, NFT launch, plan and execution. None of this is profit. It is actually negative if you add it up individually.
          </li>
          <li>20% of mint funds will be minting incentives and community collaborations during mint. IE: Purchase of partner / supportive community's and collaborations, $CRO rewards, NFT rewards.</li>
          <li>25% of mint funds go to community treasury to build the turtle brand. This will be used to increase exposure to turtle memecoin and turtle NFTs and cover any monthly, yearly expenses. Community Dao will control any major decisions on this. Unused funds will be staked and validated in CRO or in Stable liquidity pools by community vault to earn monthly for the community, growth, and monthly income for community rather than stagnant funds. Until DAO votes otherwise.</li>
          <li>5% direct buybacks of turtle off market</li>
          <li>25% for liquidity to be burned, and combined with turtle allocation of mint. Number could fluctuate up if 2625 turtle minting allocation does not max out. In this scenario, any extra minted would be used for buyback of Turtle. Once CRO VVS Finance pool reaches desired size, some of remainder can be used to make sure all remaining pools supported in collection are closest to $1000 minimum as possible. Then, grow core blue-chip pools burned liquidity. IE:USDC, WETH, WBTC</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="subheader-text text-primary mt-4">
        Turtle and NFT earning Contract:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Each NFT staked with 35,000 Turtle (number could change down, but not up) will earn 10 Turtle a day, calculated per second. This is a maximum of 38,781,250 million turtle emissions annually, first year, if max supply token and NFT were staked. This will never happen with the community owned assets and liquidity pools. At the end of each year and/or end of mint, we will adjust the emissions rate up or down based on remaining emissions from the previous year and community earnings from royalties and fees. The rates must be adjusted to always maintain an expected 3 year supply of emissions. Until the collection mints out, it is for testing to maintain sustainability and give instant rewards to holders.
      </p>
      <p class="subheader-text text-primary mt-4">
        NFT Royalties:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        50% of royalties go directly to Turtle buybacks for earning contracts, 25% to community incentives/rewards, 25% to treasury towards CTO overhead.
        <br><br>
        Royalties will start at 9% until mint is complete, and we reach a milestone of $50 floor price. It will then be reduced to 6%. Any other changes afterward will be a DAO vote.
      </p>
      <p class="subheader-text text-primary mt-4">
        Major Minting Targets:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        <ul>
          <li>
            2000 minted: Reveal images
          </li>
          <li>
            4000 minted: Start staking contract
          </li>
          <li>
            6500 minted: Start DAO contract
          </li>
        </ul>

        Once first $5000 mint funds is achieved, the first withdrawal will take place. Funds will start to be distributed according to plan, and minting incentives will start.
