        Turtle Plans

      <p class="medium-text font-weight-bold mt-2">
        Partnerships
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Already partnered with CroFomo, Croginal, Ary.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We plan to make more CronosChain and Evm partnerships as opportunities arise.
      </p>
      <p class="medium-text font-weight-bold mt-2">
        NFTs
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We are working on a large NFT collection that will bring awareness to the CronosChain, consisting of hand drawn art, and supporting all our paired assets on launch.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We are showing work in progress as we go. This will allow us funds for future developments. All funds after startup CTO costs will be divided into community treasury, buybacks for liquidity burning, and buybacks for an earning system.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Each NFT will serve as 1 vote for our Community Dao for any major expenses from community treasury post mint.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We will focus on CronosChain and evm gaming partnerships. We already have an evm partnership secured.
      </p>
      <p class="medium-text font-weight-bold mt-2">
        Earning System
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Sustainability is crucial to our vision. We’re implementing a combined token and NFT staking contract that will allow participants to earn daily rewards in Turtle tokens.
        This will be a FIXED earning system. We’re also pleased to share that we have secured three years of earnings pre-launch, providing a solid financial foundation for our future.
        As we move forward, we’ll adjust the staking rates annually based on previous usage and earnings, ensuring our approach remains sustainable and in line with community needs.
